  This is a repository that holds code that I have made by myself when first learning to code and also code that I have made while doing my bootcamp
  
## Phonebook App
**This app is only supported by windows 10 and 11 at the current moment.**

  This is a simple phonebook app that was made using Python, Tkinter, and SQlite3. When you load up the app it will calculate where the center of your screen is and will put the app in the middle. It will contain an Example already in the phonebook to give you an idea of what information you can put it. Once you have entered in your contact that you want to save to the phonebook, you may click the "Add" button and it will then upload that new information to the Database and will save it. You may then use the buttons to Update and Delete information from the Database, then once you are done you may close the phonebook and do much more.
