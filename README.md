## Phonebook App
  This is a simple phonebook app that was made using Python, Tkinter, and SQlite3. When you load up the app it will calculate where the center of your screen is and will put the app in the middle. It will contain an Example already in the phonebook to give you an idea of what information you can put it. Once you have entered in your contact that you want to save to the phonebook, you may click the "Add" button and it will then upload that new information to the Database and will save it. You may then use the buttons to Update and Delete information from the Database, then once you are done you may close the phonebook and do much more. 

## Django Checbook
  This is a full-stack site that was made in Django Framework with html and css. It is a site of a fake bank account where you can create a new account, withdraw or deposit funds and it will give you the amount that is in the account you selected and tell you when the transactions were made. You can also delete accounts if needed and everything is being backed up to sqlite3 for the database to hold and save the information put in.

## Transfer Files Gui
  This is an app made with tkinter and will pull up a small screen on your computer and will ask you to select a folder you want to get files from and then have you choose another folder where you want the files copied to and then you will click the copy button and it will make an extra copy of the files.
  
## Django University
  This is an app that will take in the information of a class subject, who the teacher is, what is the course number, and how many hours is the course. This information is then also stored within sqlite3 so you can update the information if something was put in wrong and then you can save your changes and the updates will be pushed to the database. You can also add new courses or remove others.
